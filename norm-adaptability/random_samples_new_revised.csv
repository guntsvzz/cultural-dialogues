49,49,sudan,"### Offering and Complimenting Items
- In Sudan, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is expected that you politely decline the gesture initially before accepting the third offer. This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.
- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Sudanese person may respond, “No, it’s okay”, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept the second offer.
- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Sudanese person’s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Sudanese person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.
- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Sudan whereby one’s misfortune is caused by another’s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Do not compliment something more than once or continue to praise it once you have acknowledged it. This may cause a Sudanese person to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it.
- People say “Mashallah” (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment.
- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. This is done by responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject. If they are Muslim, you may wish them Allah’s (God’s) blessings.

There is also a widely held belief that one will arrive if and when God deems it – “Inshallah” (“If God wills it”). In conjunction with this fatalistic approach, people’s views of time are often a lot more flexible than Western notions of punctuality. They tend to be more understanding of lateness and generous with their time.

363,363,ukraine,"### Basic Etiquette
- Ukrainians generally have a relaxed approach to time. Plans are often discussed loosely in everyday conversation to accommodate for delays (e.g.  “Come around seven” or “Let’s meet at about five”). It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.
- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.
- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.
- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship
- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say ‘no’ to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.
- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere. It is expected that you will insist your help to show the gesture is genuine.
- Blowing one’s nose in public is considered bad manners.
- It is impolite to yawn during conversations with others, or in public without covering your mouth.
- Throwing away food or wasting food is frowned upon, especially bread. Ukrainians tend to repurpose leftovers (e.g. by leaving them outside for stray dogs or birds to eat).
- It is inappropriate for strangers to approach someone else’s child. Close contact or friendliness is frowned upon if you do not know the child (e.g. patting the head or shoulder).
- It is polite to offer one’s seat to an elderly person, pregnant woman or children in public spaces.
- It is respectful to assist older people using transport. Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.
- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.
- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip at least 10% after a meal. Some restaurants may include the tip in the total bill.
- It is uncommon to split the bill evenly in social scenarios. Typically, the person who invited people to the meal pays for the total bill or each person pays for their own order.

- Organise your visit in advance. Americans rarely visit each other without making plans to do so.
- Many Americans have pets (e.g. dogs and cats). If you are allergic to an animal or feel uncomfortable being in the same room as an animal, you should let your host know in advance.
- Do not bring other friends and family with you unless you’ve asked your host beforehand.
- If it is an intimate visit (e.g. just you and the host), try and be as punctual as possible. It is best to notify your host if you are running late.

- It is generally normal for people to enter a home without taking their shoes off, unless the host specifically asks guests to take them off.
- In American households, it is unusual for hosts to routinely offer food or snacks – unless the guest has arrived at a meal time.

Americans tend to take their guests’ answers at face-value and are unlikely to be offended when a guest declines food. If you politely decline (e.g. ""No thanks, I'm not hungry""), do not expect your host to serve you regardless, even if the family is eating a meal.
- American households may or may not offer a small drink to guests. Guests are often expected to make a request themselves if they want something to drink. Hosts may then direct them to where and how to get the drink themselves (e.g. ""There's soda in the fridge"" or ""There's water cups in the cupboard above left of the stove”).
- Alcohol is usually only served to close friends or on special occasions.

- Spaniards may bring additional guests with them to lunch or dinner unless you explicitly tell them that a table has been reserved for a certain number of people.

- Gifts may be given upon visiting someone’s home for the first time.
- If you are invited to lunch or dinner, you may bring a gift that can be eaten for dessert (e.g. fruit, sweets, pastries).
- It is best to be subtle and humble when giving gifts. Walking straight through the door and presenting them with the gift right away would be seen as very forward and puts an Afghan in the awkward position of having to open it in front of you. Instead, try and place it near the door as you enter or on the table as you sit down so that the receiver sees it, but can open it in their own time.
- Do not give alcohol as a gift to a devout Muslim or any Afghan you do not have a close personal relationship with. If you know from first-hand experience that your friend drinks, you may give alcohol, but ensure that it is done covertly so their peers do not know. Revealing to their family or friends the fact that they drink could bring great shame on them.
- It is also inappropriate to give pig/pork-based items, such as leather.
- There are not many special customs concerning gift-wrapping so long as the gift is presented neatly. Green wrapping paper is often used for wedding presents.

585,585,japan,"### Basic Etiquette
- An important concept that informs etiquette in Japan is omotenashi, which generally translates as ‘hospitality’. It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.
- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are “Gomen nasai” (‘I’m sorry’) and “Sumimasen” (‘Excuse me’). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.
- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.
- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.
- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.
- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.
- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.

- It is polite to bring a bottle of alcohol or a cake as a gesture of thanks when visiting someone’s home. If there are children living at the home, they may expect you to bring something sweet.
- Ukrainians love giving and receiving flowers for different occasions and do so frequently. If giving flowers, the number of flowers in the bouquet should count to an odd number (e.g. 5, 7, 9). An even number of flowers is associated with funerals.
- Yellow flowers are generally avoided, white is given to girls and red is often a colour of love.
- People exchange wrapped gifts on birthdays, New Year’s and other special life events or occasions.
- It is a cultural norm for Ukrainians to exchange gifts on New Year’s Eve instead of Christmas, as New Year’s occurs prior to Orthodox Christmas (January 7th – see Dates of Significance). Christmas is usually celebrated with a meal and time spent with family rather than gift giving.
- It is customary to open wrapped gifts right away in front of the giver.
- Close friends and family may give each other money as gifts. Cash gifts may also be given at weddings.
- It is common practice for co-workers to contribute money towards buying a gift for someone on their birthday or another special event.

- When someone offers something to you (e.g. tea, sweets), refuse it initially out of politeness before accepting.
- It is rude to put your feet on the table.
- Burping and sniffing in front of others is considered rude.
- One should not touch people of the opposite gender unless they are very close family or friends.
- Conservative Iranian men may find it particularly dishonourable and disrespectful to enquire about their female family members, unless you know the family or person well.
- If you are a woman in Iran, it can be a good idea to wait for your male accompaniment to introduce you to another man before engaging with him.
- If you are a man, wait for an Iranian woman to initiate a handshake or conversation before doing so yourself.
- Respect a Shi’a Muslim’s religious duty to pray three times a day, but note that many Iranians do not observe this.
- Some religious Iranians observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.
- It is common for Iranians to be late. It can be a good idea to allow more time for an arrangement or meeting with an Iranian than you normally would as their hospitality and communication style also means engagements often take longer.

588,588,japan,"### Visiting
- It is not always common to entertain and have social events in people’s homes, in part due to the small size of most Japanese houses. To be invited into someone’s home is seen as a big honour.
- An important distinction in Japanese homes is between the inside and outside. In many houses, there is a small space between the main door and the rest of the home that acts as an intermediate space. This entrance area is known as a ‘genkan’. The size of the genkan is usually proportionate to the size of the house; small houses will have a narrow genkan while larger houses will have a more spacious genkan.
- Traditionally, the main indoor space is slightly elevated and has separate flooring from the genkan.
- Importantly, the genkan is where people remove their shoes before entering the home. This is usually done as a way to avoid bringing dirt from outside into the house. It is extremely impolite to step foot past the genkan with outdoor shoes.
- Outdoor shoes should be removed slowly, rather than kicked off the feet.
- Once someone has removed their outdoor shoes, it is common practice to place the shoes on a provided shoe rack or to point the shoes towards the door.
- Hosts will often provide guests with indoor slippers to wear while visiting the house.
- Indoor slippers are usually worn all throughout the house except for spaces in some more traditional homes that have tatami mats (a type of flooring made of woven straw).
- Some hosts may have separate slippers worn only when using the bathroom or toilet.
- People nearly always bring a gift when visiting another person’s home (see Gift Giving below for appropriate gifts).
- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit when they enter a room.
- The most important guest is offered the most honoured seat (kamiza), which is the seat furthest from the entrance.
- The least important person present (usually the host) sits in the least honoured seat (shimoza), which is the seat closest to the entrance.
- If the host does not indicate where to sit, the most appropriate choice is to sit closest to the entrance to demonstrate humility.
- Some houses and restaurants in Japan follow the tradition of sitting around a low table. Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions. However, some places have a hole under the table where people can sit and hang their legs similar to if they were sitting on a chair.
- When sitting on the floor, there are a couple of ways people are usually expected to sit. The formal Japanese sitting position is known as ‘seiza’. In this position, people sit with their legs tucked under their thighs while resting their bottom on the heels and maintaining a straight back. Women usually keep their knees together, while men have their knees slightly apart.
- In casual situations, men usually sit on the floor with their legs crossed, while women sit with both legs to one side.

- In Poland, people are expected to maintain a basic appearance of courtesy at all times. This involves paying attention and giving consideration to one’s smaller actions, being helpful and generally professional.
- Casual clothing can be considered inappropriate in public. For example, one would rarely be seen barefoot in public. People tend to dress neatly.
- It is considered impolite to ask a woman her age.
- Some Poles (especially those who are older) take the time to show women a heightened degree of respect and consideration. They may offer their hand to assist a woman in getting out of her seat, offer their arm for women to walk, and hold or open doors for women. It is also polite to stand when a woman enters the room or offer her your seat if she needs one. This chivalry may not be so relevant for those born after the 1960s.
- It’s considered bad manners to keep your hands in your pockets while talking to someone.
- Avoid resting your ankle on your other knee whilst sitting.
- Jaywalking, drinking in public places and smoking in non-designated areas are all generally frowned upon.
- Lateness is a sign of bad manners and carelessness in Poland. People are expected to be punctual in both professional and social situations. However, tardiness is still fairly common. Furthermore, it is good to be flexible as events and schedules can be delayed or changed quite rapidly around unforeseen circumstances.

830,830,israel,"### Religious Dietary Laws
- Kashrut refers to the Jewish dietary laws that describe foods suitable for a religiously Jewish person to consume. Jewish dietary laws make a distinction between kosher (appropriate) and terefah (forbidden). Some foods are inherently kosher for consumption (such as fish that have both fins and scales) or inherently terefah (such as pork). However, other foods require a prescribed method of preparation and slaughter. If this method is not followed, the food is classified as forbidden.
- One main Jewish dietary law is the separation of meat and dairy in the same meal. As such, some of Israel’s cuisine does not contain dishes with both meat and dairy mixed together.
- Some Jewish Israeli households will have separate cooking utensils to ensure the separation of meat and dairy.
- Some Jewish Israelis may also wait several hours after eating a meat dish before consuming dairy to avoid the mixing of meat and dairy in their stomach. The waiting time may be up to nine hours.
- Muslim families and restaurants observe Islamic dietary rules, which categorise foods as either allowed (halal) or forbidden (haram). Generally, all food and drink is halal except for specifically forbidden cases (such as meat that has not been prepared and slaughtered according to halal standards, and pork).
- Foods that abide by Jewish dietary laws are considered halal for Muslims.

- Lunch is the main meal of the day in North Macedonia. It is eaten at around 2pm. Dinner is eaten later after an afternoon siesta.
- If you are eating at someone’s house or restaurant, plan to be there for at least two hours. Meals are often prolonged as people socialise.
- At formal meals, the head of the family may sit at the end of the table with the godmother and godfather on either side.
- People serve themselves from dishes placed in the centre of the table. If you wish to have a second helping, you similarly serve yourself.
- Expect to be offered more servings than you are prepared to eat. You may have to politely insist that you are full.
- It is polite to eat all the food on your plate and leave it empty when finished.
- Sometimes, Macedonians may serve ‘mezze’ instead of a full meal. This is a selection of small dishes that accompany alcoholic drinks. The dishes will be paired to match the alcohol served. For example, salad is meant to be the accompaniment to hard spirits.
- Muslim Macedonians may not consume alcohol or pork in accordance with Islamic principles.
- Christian Macedonians generally drink alcohol with their meals and make toasts of friendship and agreements. ‘Rakija’ (a fruity brandy) is a popular drink. The common toast is “Nazdravje” meaning “for your health”.
- If dining out to eat, friends usually discuss the bill prior and agree as to whether everyone will pay for themselves. The bill is usually split evenly among all unless a person volunteers to pay. If someone specifically invites the others out for dinner or drinks, it is expected that they will pay.

688,688,palestinian_territories,"### Eating
- Cleanliness is very important in Palestinian culture. Wash your hands thoroughly before eating.
- Notify your host about any dietary requirements in advance (e.g. vegetarian). Palestinian hosts often go to great lengths to provide plenty of food for their guests and can be very disappointed if the person refuses to eat what they have prepared.
- Most Palestinian families generally eat their main meal together, including during Ramadan. Men and women may eat separately in some circumstances (e.g. if the family is highly religious or the number of people eating is too large).
- It is important to wait for everyone to be present before starting to eat, even if the meal is casual. Palestinians try not to eat separately out of respect for the family.
- The father is usually served first out of respect, followed by the mother. However, guests are served first if present.
- Palestinians generally eat with the right hand. It is impolite to pass food to one’s mouth with the left.
- Most families eat with utensils from separate plates. However, some traditional Palestinian food may be served on a common dish from which people serve themselves with their hands.
- Practising Muslims do not eat anything containing alcohol or pork, in accordance with Islamic custom.
- It is polite to accept multiple helpings (if offered) to show how much you enjoy the meal and your host’s hospitality. Refusing food can be interpreted as rude. However, be aware that servings may be rationed in some low-income families.
- According to Muslim practice, it is advisable to finish your plate. However, hosts may put extra food on a guest’s plate out of respect or prompt their guests to have more servings than they can feasibly eat. It is acceptable to decline this or leave food on your plate if you simply cannot finish the meal.
- Some people politely leave some food on their plate at the end of the meal to indicate to the host that they have provided adequately. Otherwise, if your plate is empty, your host may keep refilling it with more helpings of food.
- As a host, try not to eat quickly and wait until everyone has eaten a fair amount before saying you’re full. It is customary for everyone to stop eating and conclude the meal once the guest is full or finished.
- After the meal has finished, a serving of tea, fruits, sweets or coffee is commonly offered. Coffee is often served at the conclusion of a meal. Usually, guests leave soon after drinking the coffee.
