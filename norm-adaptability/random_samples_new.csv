590,590,japan,"### Eating
- In some Japanese restaurants, customers may be given a small rolled hand towel known as a ‘oshibori’. It is usually used to wipe your hands before eating, and it is considered impolite to use the oshibori to wipe your face or neck.
- Traditionally, meals begin with the statement “Itadakimasu”, which literally means ‘I humbly receive’, but is used in a similar fashion as saying ‘bon appetit’ or ‘enjoy your meal’. The statement expresses gratitude for those who contributed to providing and preparing the meal.
- It is impolite to begin eating before everyone has gathered at the table, ready to partake in the meal.
- The most honoured guest or highest-ranked person eats first. Once they have begun, everyone is invited to begin their meal.
- Chopsticks are the most common utensils used when eating, sometimes accompanied with a soup spoon.
- For disposable chopsticks, it is considered rude to rub them together. This may imply to the restaurant owner that the customer views the restaurant as cheap.
- When chopsticks are not being used, they are usually laid down in front of the person with the tips to the left.
- It is highly inappropriate to stick chopsticks into food, especially into a bowl of rice. This practice of placing chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a funerary practice known as ‘tsukitate-bashi’.
- Food is never passed directly from one person’s chopsticks to another.
- Pointing or waving at people or objects with chopsticks is considered to be impolite.
- Chewing with one’s mouth open is considered impolite.
- When eating soup or rice, it is acceptable to lift the bowl closer to your mouth to avoid spilling food. Generally, miso soup (which accompanies many meals) is drunk directly from the bowl, while larger soups are usually consumed by using a soup spoon.
- White rice is a common staple component of most Japanese meals. The rice often comes with accompaniments.
- It is considered impolite for someone to blow their nose at the table, as well as make other loud noises such as burping or munching. The exception to this is slurping, which is socially acceptable for certain foods, especially noodle dishes such as ramen.
- Leaving a plate completely empty after a meal signifies to the host that you are satisfied and do not wish to be served more food.
- It is not considered impolite to leave food on the plate when being served by others. However, when serving oneself, it is rude to over-serve and not complete the meal.
- Once a meal is complete, a common phrase stated is “Gochisousama-deshita”, which is generally understood as a statement of gratitude for the effort and the expense of the meal.
- People generally avoid eating or drinking while walking in public settings. If someone purchases a takeaway drink (especially from a vending machine), they usually drink the beverage near the machine and recycle the packaging in the nearby bin.
- The most common alcoholic beverage in Japan is sake, a brewed alcohol made from fermented rice. It can be consumed either hot or cold. Other distilled spirits such as whiskey are also quite popular as well as beer.
- Before everyone drinks their first alcoholic beverage, people usually hold up their drinks and toast with the phrase “Kampai”.
- When drinking alcoholic beverages, people customarily serve each other instead of pouring their own drink. Whoever you are dining with will typically periodically check your cup and refill if your drink is empty.
- If you do not wish to be served more beverages, it is customary to leave a little in the cup to indicate to others not to refill.
- A popular non-alcoholic beverage widely consumed in Japan is green tea. People may serve green tea as an accompaniment to a main meal, or as the basis of an afternoon tea with some sweets.
- Tipping is not practised in Japan. There is a general belief that the prices listed for meals or services are fair, and tipping implies otherwise.

49,49,sudan,"### Offering and Complimenting Items
- In Sudan, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is expected that you politely decline the gesture initially before accepting the third offer. This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.
- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Sudanese person may respond, “No, it’s okay”, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept the second offer.
- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Sudanese person’s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Sudanese person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.
- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Sudan whereby one’s misfortune is caused by another’s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Do not compliment something more than once or continue to praise it once you have acknowledged it. This may cause a Sudanese person to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it.
- People say “Mashallah” (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment.
- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. This is done by responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject. If they are Muslim, you may wish them Allah’s (God’s) blessings.

595,595,japan,"### Gift Giving
- Gift giving (zōtō) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.
- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.
- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is Chūgen, which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is Seibo, which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for Chūgen and Seibo that are already appropriately wrapped.
- During Chūgen, people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.
- During Seibo, gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.
- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.
- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.
- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.
- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.
- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.
- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.
- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.
- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.
- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as ‘omiyage’ or ‘temiyage’ depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.
- Omiyage is often translated as ‘souvenir’ but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.
- Temiyage refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone’s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.
- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.
- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone’s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.
- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.

- Use your right hand or both hands together to gesture or offer anything. The left hand is used for cleaning and hygiene purposes and should not be used to gesture or touch things (e.g. food/people). See more under Communication.

- It is very difficult to be punctual during one’s daily activities in Afghanistan as various incidents often occur (whether it be a pressing family matter, terrible traffic in cities, roadblocks, a power outage or an insurgent-related threat). There is also a widely held belief that one will arrive if and when God deems it – “Inshallah” (“If God wills it”). In conjunction with this fatalistic approach, people’s views of time are often a lot more flexible than Western notions of punctuality. They tend to be more understanding of lateness and generous with their time.

- Pork is also prohibited in Islam. Do not serve food containing pork or pork byproducts (e.g. gelatine) to your Saudi counterpart.
- It is polite to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the daylight hours of the fasting month of Ramadan. In Saudi Arabia, it is considered disrespectful to engage in these activities in public.

- It is important to wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating.
- Food can either be served on a large plate set on the floor or on a table.

- Do not bring other friends and family with you unless you’ve asked your host beforehand.
- If it is an intimate visit (e.g. just you and the host), try and be as punctual as possible. It is best to notify your host if you are running late.
- If it is a larger social gathering or party, Americans commonly arrive roughly 30 minutes to an hour after the stated time. This is especially common if the guest doesn’t know the host very personally, or does not know many of the other people attending .
- It is generally normal for people to enter a home without taking their shoes off, unless the host specifically asks guests to take them off.
- In American households, it is unusual for hosts to routinely offer food or snacks – unless the guest has arrived at a meal time.
- If the host asks whether you would like food, it is expected you answer honestly. Americans tend to take their guests’ answers at face-value and are unlikely to be offended when a guest declines food. If you politely decline (e.g. ""No thanks, I'm not hungry""), do not expect your host to serve you regardless, even if the family is eating a meal.
- American households may or may not offer a small drink to guests. Guests are often expected to make a request themselves if they want something to drink. Hosts may then direct them to where and how to get the drink themselves (e.g. ""There's soda in the fridge"" or ""There's water cups in the cupboard above left of the stove”).
- Alcohol is usually only served to close friends or on special occasions.
- Avoid overstaying your welcome by remaining at a person's home longer than expected, unless they explicitly ask you to stay.

67,67,spain,"### Eating
- All meals of the day commence later in Spain than what people are familiar with in the English-speaking West. Lunch (la comida) is the main meal of the day. It is generally eaten between 2pm and 4pm. Meanwhile, dinner (la cena) is rarely eaten before 9pm. It can begin at 10pm on weekends, or even later.
- People dine at restaurants (restaurantes or comedors) for full meals or bars that serve ‘tapas/pinchos’ (small snacks) and ‘raciones’ (larger portions intended for sharing). Bars tend to work out to be more expensive, but have more variety.
- Spaniards may bring additional guests with them to lunch or dinner unless you explicitly tell them that a table has been reserved for a certain number of people.
- In Spain, people often choose their own table at a restaurant instead of waiting to be seated. At someone’s home, wait until the host indicates everyone should take a seat before sitting.
- Do not start eating until the host or person who invited everyone indicates it is time to start.
- Keep your hands visible above the table, with your wrists resting on the edge.
- The host gives the first toast, which is returned by the guest later in the meal.
- In Spain, people toast by saying “Salud!” (Health!).
- It is impolite to waste food. Therefore, try to eat everything on your plate. It is better to decline a large portion or second serving rather than leaving food on your plate.
- Spaniards rarely drink tap water at restaurants. People are usually served bottled water or are expected to purchase a beverage, such as a small beer (caña) or wine.
- Avoid getting too drunk at a meal. Spanish generally do not drink very heavily at meals. They tend to talk over one glass for a long time.
- Bread is commonly served in a wicker basket on the side of meals.
- People often use bread to eat any remaining sauces or leftovers on their plate after finishing their dish.
- It is common to take a leisurely stroll (paseo) outdoors before or after dinner. People also sit around the table talking for a long time after the meal concludes. This is called ‘la sobremesa’.

8,8,egypt,"### Eating
- It is considered to be a compliment to take second helpings.
- Leave a small amount of food on your plate once you have finished eating. This symbolises abundance and serves as a compliment to the host for providing so well.
- It is not common for people to salt their serving of food as it is considered to be ‘unnecessary’.
- Complimenting food should be done in a statement rather than a question. For example, questioning the method of the cooking (e.g. ‘how was this made?’) means that one is sceptical of the food.
- Avoid eating communal food with your left hand, as this hand is generally reserved for personal hygiene. Only the right hand is used when eating food with one’s hands.
- Alcohol is generally not offered nor is it consumed with food. Only offer alcohol to your Egyptian counterpart if you know that they consume it.
- It is considered offensive to offer pork to Muslims as pigs and products relating to pigs (such as pork and pig leather) are prohibited in the Islamic religion.

- Gifts may be given upon visiting someone’s home for the first time.
- If you are invited to lunch or dinner, you may bring a gift that can be eaten for dessert (e.g. fruit, sweets, pastries).
- It is best to be subtle and humble when giving gifts. Walking straight through the door and presenting them with the gift right away would be seen as very forward and puts an Afghan in the awkward position of having to open it in front of you. Instead, try and place it near the door as you enter or on the table as you sit down so that the receiver sees it, but can open it in their own time.
- Do not give alcohol as a gift to a devout Muslim or any Afghan you do not have a close personal relationship with. If you know from first-hand experience that your friend drinks, you may give alcohol, but ensure that it is done covertly so their peers do not know. Revealing to their family or friends the fact that they drink could bring great shame on them.
- It is also inappropriate to give pig/pork-based items, such as leather.
- There are not many special customs concerning gift-wrapping so long as the gift is presented neatly. Green wrapping paper is often used for wedding presents.

585,585,japan,"### Basic Etiquette
- An important concept that informs etiquette in Japan is omotenashi, which generally translates as ‘hospitality’. It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.
- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are “Gomen nasai” (‘I’m sorry’) and “Sumimasen” (‘Excuse me’). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.
- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.
- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.
- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.
- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.
- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.

376,376,ukraine,"### Gift Giving
- It is polite to bring a bottle of alcohol or a cake as a gesture of thanks when visiting someone’s home. If there are children living at the home, they may expect you to bring something sweet.
- Ukrainians love giving and receiving flowers for different occasions and do so frequently. If giving flowers, the number of flowers in the bouquet should count to an odd number (e.g. 5, 7, 9). An even number of flowers is associated with funerals.
- Yellow flowers are generally avoided, white is given to girls and red is often a colour of love.
- People exchange wrapped gifts on birthdays, New Year’s and other special life events or occasions.
- It is a cultural norm for Ukrainians to exchange gifts on New Year’s Eve instead of Christmas, as New Year’s occurs prior to Orthodox Christmas (January 7th – see Dates of Significance). Christmas is usually celebrated with a meal and time spent with family rather than gift giving.
- It is customary to open wrapped gifts right away in front of the giver.
- Close friends and family may give each other money as gifts. Cash gifts may also be given at weddings.
- It is common practice for co-workers to contribute money towards buying a gift for someone on their birthday or another special event.

- It is rude to put your feet on the table.
- Burping and sniffing in front of others is considered rude.
- One should not touch people of the opposite gender unless they are very close family or friends.
- Conservative Iranian men may find it particularly dishonourable and disrespectful to enquire about their female family members, unless you know the family or person well.
- If you are a woman in Iran, it can be a good idea to wait for your male accompaniment to introduce you to another man before engaging with him.
- If you are a man, wait for an Iranian woman to initiate a handshake or conversation before doing so yourself.
- Respect a Shi’a Muslim’s religious duty to pray three times a day, but note that many Iranians do not observe this.
- Some religious Iranians observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.
- It is common for Iranians to be late. It can be a good idea to allow more time for an arrangement or meeting with an Iranian than you normally would as their hospitality and communication style also means engagements often take longer.

588,588,japan,"### Visiting
- It is not always common to entertain and have social events in people’s homes, in part due to the small size of most Japanese houses. To be invited into someone’s home is seen as a big honour.
- An important distinction in Japanese homes is between the inside and outside. In many houses, there is a small space between the main door and the rest of the home that acts as an intermediate space. This entrance area is known as a ‘genkan’. The size of the genkan is usually proportionate to the size of the house; small houses will have a narrow genkan while larger houses will have a more spacious genkan.
- Traditionally, the main indoor space is slightly elevated and has separate flooring from the genkan.
- Importantly, the genkan is where people remove their shoes before entering the home. This is usually done as a way to avoid bringing dirt from outside into the house. It is extremely impolite to step foot past the genkan with outdoor shoes.
- Outdoor shoes should be removed slowly, rather than kicked off the feet.
- Once someone has removed their outdoor shoes, it is common practice to place the shoes on a provided shoe rack or to point the shoes towards the door.
- Hosts will often provide guests with indoor slippers to wear while visiting the house.
- Indoor slippers are usually worn all throughout the house except for spaces in some more traditional homes that have tatami mats (a type of flooring made of woven straw).
- Some hosts may have separate slippers worn only when using the bathroom or toilet.
- People nearly always bring a gift when visiting another person’s home (see Gift Giving below for appropriate gifts).
- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit when they enter a room.
- The most important guest is offered the most honoured seat (kamiza), which is the seat furthest from the entrance.
- The least important person present (usually the host) sits in the least honoured seat (shimoza), which is the seat closest to the entrance.
- If the host does not indicate where to sit, the most appropriate choice is to sit closest to the entrance to demonstrate humility.
- Some houses and restaurants in Japan follow the tradition of sitting around a low table. Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions. However, some places have a hole under the table where people can sit and hang their legs similar to if they were sitting on a chair.
- When sitting on the floor, there are a couple of ways people are usually expected to sit. The formal Japanese sitting position is known as ‘seiza’. In this position, people sit with their legs tucked under their thighs while resting their bottom on the heels and maintaining a straight back. Women usually keep their knees together, while men have their knees slightly apart.
- In casual situations, men usually sit on the floor with their legs crossed, while women sit with both legs to one side.

201,201,poland,"### Basic Etiquette
- In Poland, people are expected to maintain a basic appearance of courtesy at all times. This involves paying attention and giving consideration to one’s smaller actions, being helpful and generally professional.
- Casual clothing can be considered inappropriate in public. For example, one would rarely be seen barefoot in public. People tend to dress neatly.
- It is considered impolite to ask a woman her age.
- Some Poles (especially those who are older) take the time to show women a heightened degree of respect and consideration. They may offer their hand to assist a woman in getting out of her seat, offer their arm for women to walk, and hold or open doors for women. It is also polite to stand when a woman enters the room or offer her your seat if she needs one. This chivalry may not be so relevant for those born after the 1960s.
- It’s considered bad manners to keep your hands in your pockets while talking to someone.
- Avoid resting your ankle on your other knee whilst sitting.
- Jaywalking, drinking in public places and smoking in non-designated areas are all generally frowned upon.
- Lateness is a sign of bad manners and carelessness in Poland. People are expected to be punctual in both professional and social situations. However, tardiness is still fairly common. Furthermore, it is good to be flexible as events and schedules can be delayed or changed quite rapidly around unforeseen circumstances.

- It is sometimes preferred to socialise in public group activities rather than in people’s homes. Hence, Germans generally do not invite people to visit their house on a regular basis unless they are very close.
- Organise your visit in advance. Germans rarely visit each other without making plans to do so.
- Be punctual on arrival. Tardiness of around 10 to 15 minutes can be forgiven.
- It is a nice gesture to bring flowers, wine or sweets when visiting a German home.
- Hosts usually serve refreshments, even if the visit is only going to be short.
- Do not enter into other rooms of the house unless the host invites you to. Guests are expected to respect the homeowner's privacy.
- Visits to one’s house during the daytime are usually short, between one to two hours long. However, they are usually more prolonged in the afternoon. This is considered ‘Kaffeeklatsch’ time when refreshments are served as an afternoon tea.

830,830,israel,"### Religious Dietary Laws
- Kashrut refers to the Jewish dietary laws that describe foods suitable for a religiously Jewish person to consume. Jewish dietary laws make a distinction between kosher (appropriate) and terefah (forbidden). Some foods are inherently kosher for consumption (such as fish that have both fins and scales) or inherently terefah (such as pork). However, other foods require a prescribed method of preparation and slaughter. If this method is not followed, the food is classified as forbidden.
- One main Jewish dietary law is the separation of meat and dairy in the same meal. As such, some of Israel’s cuisine does not contain dishes with both meat and dairy mixed together.
- Some Jewish Israeli households will have separate cooking utensils to ensure the separation of meat and dairy.
- Some Jewish Israelis may also wait several hours after eating a meat dish before consuming dairy to avoid the mixing of meat and dairy in their stomach. The waiting time may be up to nine hours.
- Muslim families and restaurants observe Islamic dietary rules, which categorise foods as either allowed (halal) or forbidden (haram). Generally, all food and drink is halal except for specifically forbidden cases (such as meat that has not been prepared and slaughtered according to halal standards, and pork).
- Foods that abide by Jewish dietary laws are considered halal for Muslims.

However, it is considered bad etiquette to pass, serve or spoon food to one’s mouth with the left hand. It should be used to hold the plate or assist the right hand in serving food.
- Bangladeshis often offer their guests additional helpings of food. It is acceptable to refuse, however, expect the host to insist. It can be easier and also more polite to graciously accept.
- Plates are taken to a main dish for serving rather than passing food around the table.

- Waiters, waitresses and service attendants expect tips to make their living. Accordingly, restaurants that offer table service do not include the service charge in the cost of the bill.
- Canadians usually tip 15-20% of the cost of the meal as a general standard. More or less can be tipped depending on the quality of the service.

- Be careful to watch for signs that a recipient does not want to receive the gift.

If you give a gift that is overtly grand, a Malaysian may feel ashamed if they cannot reciprocate such a gesture.
- Gifts should not be opened immediately when they are received or in front of the giver. This avoids the loss of face on either end of the exchange if the recipient is not happy with the present.
- Avoid giving money to your Malaysian counterpart as a gift. If doing so, it should count to an even number.
- Do not give knives or scissors as gifts as they represent the severing of relationships.

681,681,palestinian_territories,"### Offering and Complimenting Items
- Palestinians generally extend an offer multiple times. It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver’s humbleness. Accepting on the first offer can seem greedy.
- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Palestinian may respond, “No, it’s okay”, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.
- Many Palestinians hold a strong belief in the evil eye whereby one’s misfortune is caused by another’s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Do not compliment something more than once or continue to praise it once you have acknowledged it. This may cause a person to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it. It is best to make compliments more general (e.g. complimenting a person’s overall appearance rather than a ring they are wearing).
- Muslims may say “Mashallah” (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment. Doing so also shows that one doesn't have bad intentions by the comment.
- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. For example, responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject.

- Most Palestinian families generally eat their main meal together, including during Ramadan. Men and women may eat separately in some circumstances (e.g. if the family is highly religious or the number of people eating is too large).
- It is important to wait for everyone to be present before starting to eat, even if the meal is casual. Palestinians try not to eat separately out of respect for the family.

It is acceptable to decline this or leave food on your plate if you simply cannot finish the meal.
- Some people politely leave some food on their plate at the end of the meal to indicate to the host that they have provided adequately. Otherwise, if your plate is empty, your host may keep refilling it with more helpings of food.

- After the meal has finished, a serving of tea, fruits, sweets or coffee is commonly offered. Coffee is often served at the conclusion of a meal. Usually, guests leave soon after drinking the coffee.

- In Somalia, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is expected that you politely decline the gesture initially before accepting the third offer. This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.
- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Somali may respond, “No, it’s okay”, out of modesty and politeness even though they intend to accept the second offer.
- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Somali’s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Somali is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.
- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Somalia whereby one’s misfortune can be caused by another’s envy (xasad) of one’s possessions or success, sometimes taking the form of a curse.

- Ukrainians tend to be very caring hosts and highly attentive to guests’ needs. They are unlikely to ask guests for help and often avoid drawing attention to themselves or any imposition when hosting. Similarly, Ukrainian guests may not speak about their needs openly or directly when in another person’s home.

- Take your shoes off when you enter somebody’s house. Some households may offer guests slippers on entry.
- Guests are not usually asked to bring food or drinks when visiting someone’s house. However, it’s customary to bring a bottle of alcohol or a cake as a gesture of thanks.

- Guests usually stay for as long as they wish and goodbyes can be quite prolonged from the time that someone actually announces his or her departure. It can often take several attempts and toasts to clear the door.
- People may not wish to give an outright announcement when the night is at its end. The final toast (Na Konya!) is the best indication that it is time for guests to leave. See Toasting for more information.

- Wash your hands before eating.
- Pass all food with your right hand. Do not touch food with your left hand unless using utensils.
- If fruit is offered, cut slices off for yourself as you eat instead of biting into it.
- It is polite to accept everything offered. If you refuse something, they may see it as a token protest made out of politeness and will therefore insist that you receive what is given instead of accepting your refusal. This can lead to awkward situations in which non-Iraqis may feel the offer is being forced upon them.
- You will likely be served second or even third servings. It is a great gesture to eat more servings, so it is best serve yourself less initially so you have more room to eat another serving.
- If you honestly would not like anymore food, the best way to refuse a serving is to place your hand over your heart and give your thanks whilst saying you are full and the host provided greatly.
- Leave a little food on your plate when you are finished as eating everything on your plate indicates that you would like another serving.

- Remove your shoes when you enter a Saudi Arabian home (especially on carpeted floors), unless instructed otherwise.
- The genders are generally segregated during visits. In Saudi Arabia, many households have two different ‘majlis’ (living room/place of sitting/private place for discussion) so men and women can socialise separately.
- Once segregated from the men, the women of both families can unveil in front of one another.
- Men give women notice before entering an area of the house where unrelated women are socialising to give them time to cover up. For example, if a sister has her female friends visiting, her brother will announce “Ya allah!” before he walks in the room.
- Male guests are usually served by the youngest son or a male domestic worker, while female guests are served by the youngest daughter or a female maid.
- It is customary to be offered Arabic coffee and dates upon arrival. Coffee is often served in a ‘finjan’ (small cup).
- It is good to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.
- Coffee is followed by a sweet of some kind, usually a mint and/or ginger tea.
- Hosts will continue to refill guest’s cups until the guest indicates they’ve had enough by covering the mouth of the cup with their hand or gently shaking the cup from side to side and saying “Bas” (Enough).
- It is improper/unclean for people to drink out of the same cup.
- Hosts may light ‘Oud’ or agawood (a form of incense or oil) during a guest’s visit.

457,457,france,"### Eating
- Table manners are highly regarded in France. Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.
- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.
- When one begins a meal, they typically say “bon appétit” (enjoy your meal).
- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.
- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.
- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.
- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit déjeuner (breakfast), le déjeuner (lunch) and le dîner (dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.
- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entrée, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.
- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the ‘apéro’ (also known as ‘l’apéritif’), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an apéro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an apéro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.
- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.
- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone’s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.

368,368,ukraine,"### Visiting
- Ukrainians generally take great pride in their hospitality. The best food and belongings are always reserved for guests even if this generosity extends beyond their means (e.g. offering the best bedroom and bed linen, using the nicest cutlery, opening the most expensive bottle of wine).
- Ukrainians tend to be very caring hosts and highly attentive to guests’ needs. They are unlikely to ask guests for help and often avoid drawing attention to themselves or any imposition when hosting. Similarly, Ukrainian guests may not speak about their needs openly or directly when in another person’s home.
- Do not wait to be told how you can contribute or cater to a Ukrainian. It is important to ask your guest questions or offer your help to a host whenever possible to show you care.
- Take your shoes off when you enter somebody’s house. Some households may offer guests slippers on entry.
- Guests are not usually asked to bring food or drinks when visiting someone’s house. However, it’s customary to bring a bottle of alcohol or a cake as a gesture of thanks. Alcohol is usually a more appropriate gift for men. If a woman lives at the house, it’s common practice to bring flowers and give them to her as you enter the home.
- Aperitifs or ‘cocktail hours’ are not common at Ukrainian parties. Guests are usually taken straight to a table for a sit-down dinner (see Eating).
- Buffeting or walking around with food while socialising is not common.
- Do not open the fridge or cupboards in the house without the hosts’ permission.
- Guests usually stay for as long as they wish and goodbyes can be quite prolonged from the time that someone actually announces his or her departure. It can often take several attempts and toasts to clear the door.
- People may not wish to give an outright announcement when the night is at its end. The final toast (Na Konya!) is the best indication that it is time for guests to leave. See Toasting for more information.

591,591,japan,"### Eating
- In some Japanese restaurants, customers may be given a small rolled hand towel known as a ‘oshibori’. It is usually used to wipe your hands before eating, and it is considered impolite to use the oshibori to wipe your face or neck.
- Traditionally, meals begin with the statement “Itadakimasu”, which literally means ‘I humbly receive’, but is used in a similar fashion as saying ‘bon appetit’ or ‘enjoy your meal’. The statement expresses gratitude for those who contributed to providing and preparing the meal.
- It is impolite to begin eating before everyone has gathered at the table, ready to partake in the meal.
- The most honoured guest or highest-ranked person eats first. Once they have begun, everyone is invited to begin their meal.
- Chopsticks are the most common utensils used when eating, sometimes accompanied with a soup spoon.
- For disposable chopsticks, it is considered rude to rub them together. This may imply to the restaurant owner that the customer views the restaurant as cheap.
- When chopsticks are not being used, they are usually laid down in front of the person with the tips to the left.
- It is highly inappropriate to stick chopsticks into food, especially into a bowl of rice. This practice of placing chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a funerary practice known as ‘tsukitate-bashi’.
- Food is never passed directly from one person’s chopsticks to another.
- Pointing or waving at people or objects with chopsticks is considered to be impolite.
- Chewing with one’s mouth open is considered impolite.
- When eating soup or rice, it is acceptable to lift the bowl closer to your mouth to avoid spilling food. Generally, miso soup (which accompanies many meals) is drunk directly from the bowl, while larger soups are usually consumed by using a soup spoon.
- White rice is a common staple component of most Japanese meals. The rice often comes with accompaniments.
- It is considered impolite for someone to blow their nose at the table, as well as make other loud noises such as burping or munching. The exception to this is slurping, which is socially acceptable for certain foods, especially noodle dishes such as ramen.
- Leaving a plate completely empty after a meal signifies to the host that you are satisfied and do not wish to be served more food.
- It is not considered impolite to leave food on the plate when being served by others. However, when serving oneself, it is rude to over-serve and not complete the meal.
- Once a meal is complete, a common phrase stated is “Gochisousama-deshita”, which is generally understood as a statement of gratitude for the effort and the expense of the meal.
- People generally avoid eating or drinking while walking in public settings. If someone purchases a takeaway drink (especially from a vending machine), they usually drink the beverage near the machine and recycle the packaging in the nearby bin.
- The most common alcoholic beverage in Japan is sake, a brewed alcohol made from fermented rice. It can be consumed either hot or cold. Other distilled spirits such as whiskey are also quite popular as well as beer.
- Before everyone drinks their first alcoholic beverage, people usually hold up their drinks and toast with the phrase “Kampai”.
- When drinking alcoholic beverages, people customarily serve each other instead of pouring their own drink. Whoever you are dining with will typically periodically check your cup and refill if your drink is empty.
- If you do not wish to be served more beverages, it is customary to leave a little in the cup to indicate to others not to refill.
- A popular non-alcoholic beverage widely consumed in Japan is green tea. People may serve green tea as an accompaniment to a main meal, or as the basis of an afternoon tea with some sweets.
- Tipping is not practised in Japan. There is a general belief that the prices listed for meals or services are fair, and tipping implies otherwise.

- Greeks generally take a lot of pride in their hosting skills. The tradition of hospitality traces back to ancient times when people believed a guest on a doorstep could be a god in disguise.
- Greeks tend to be very generous at giving invitations, even upon first meeting people. You may find that an invitation to have coffee leads to an invitation to dinner, escalating to an invitation to join a family event. Try to accept this as part of the forthcoming nature of Greek culture.

- Gift giving is not essential when visiting one’s home, but it can be a thoughtful gesture to bring a small gift of flowers, sweets or wine.

This could be an invitation for you to stay longer, eat, drink or even take something home with you when you leave. As a general guideline, if the host has insisted on anything several times, you should appease them by accommodating their request.
- Always make an effort to compliment your host’s hospitality.
- Expect social activity to carry on late into the evening.

- People tend to open gifts in front of the giver, either upon receiving them or later along with other presents.
- If you are presented with a gift on behalf of a Māori person or community, it is expected that you open it right away.1
- Recipients do not usually expect to receive gifts of a high monetary value, but rather expect that the gift will be thoughtfully chosen to reflect their interests.
- Token gifts may be given when visiting someone (e.g. wine, chocolate, or flowers).
- Guests invited to a Māori house should bring a small simple gift, known as a ‘koha’. Koha is used to show thanks for hospitality and is often given in the form of food, drinks, flowers or photos of your homeland.
- There are no set expectations on the monetary value of koha items. It is expected that koha should only be what people can afford. However, as a general guideline $20 NZD per person is a standard koha when visiting a marae for personal reasons. For business or government service related visits, additional koha of a larger sum should be provided by your organisation.
- Visitors should give their koha to one person who presents it on behalf of the group. If you are staying overnight (noho marae), it is good practice to contact the marae chair beforehand to organise an appropriate koha to cover all costs related to your stay.2

812,812,saudi_arabia,"### Offering and Complimenting Items
- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Saudi Arabia whereby one’s misfortune is caused by another’s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Complimenting or praising something too heavily can cause some Saudis to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it or curse it. People say “Mashallah” (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment and avoid hurting people’s feelings. This phrase comforts people as it lets them know that you are giving an innocent compliment and do not wish harm. Expect to hear it highly frequently in conversation, and say it after every compliment.
- In Saudi Arabia, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver’s humbleness.
- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Saudi person may respond, “No, it’s okay”, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.
- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Saudi person’s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Saudi person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.
- It is thought to be more sincere if compliments are given out of sight or earshot of the person who owns the possession or thing you are praising.
- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. This is done by responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject. If they are Muslim, you may wish them Allah’s (God’s) blessings.

- If there is a visitor, Filipinos are reluctant to take the last serving of any shared food served at a meal.
- If someone is eating and someone walks past, many Filipinos will offer the person passing by to stop and eat. However, this is not a literal offer but rather out of respect.

722,722,new_zealand,"### Māori Etiquette
- Sites or objects that Māori regard as tapu (sacred) are not to be touched or interacted with.
- The head is considered to be the most sacred part of the body and should not come into contact with other body parts.
- It is a cultural taboo to touch someone else’s head without permission.
- Do not sit on a pillow used for a person to rest their head during sleep. Similarly, pillows that are used for seating or to prop legs, arms, etc. should not be then moved under the head. Māori may view this as a violation of tapu.5
- Most cooked food items are considered to be normal/ordinary (noa) in Maori culture. This means they must not come into contact with sacred objects, people or spaces.
- Do not bring food into any buildings, spaces or places considered tapu, such as the wharenui (traditional meeting house) in a marae (traditional Māori meeting ground).
- Food should not be passed over an individual’s head.
- It is a cultural taboo to sit on tables, countertops or other surfaces that are used for food preparation or eating.
- There may be ritual protocols to bless or cleanse a tapu space or place before you enter, such as reciting a karakia or cleansing the area with water.
- Ask a Māori person’s permission before photographing, filming or taping them.
- Some Maori communities may not allow digital recording devices into their marae (traditional meeting ground) or other sites of significance. Recording these places without permission can be a violation of tapu.6
- Some Māori have tribal tattoos on their faces, arms and calves that have cultural and spiritual significance. These do not hold negative connotations (i.e. prison sentences) as they do in some other cultures. All traditional Māori tribal tattoos are deeply personal and unique to the individual’s tribal group, representing important family history and/or tribal narratives.
- The wearing of pounamu (greenstone) and/or bone necklaces is common practice among Māori. The shape of each pounamu carries important meaning.
- It is appropriate to ask about the significance of a person’s pounamu if you are interested.
- Non-Māori may wear pounamu if they have been gifted it. To be gifted a piece signifies much about the value and respect between the giver and receiver.7
- It is not uncommon for non-Māori New Zealanders to wear pounamu or get Māori-inspired tattoos. However, this is often for aesthetic purposes, as opposed to traditional cultural practices.
- While it is not necessarily culturally inappropriate for non-Māori to purchase pounamu for themselves, it is generally advised against as it diminishes the cultural significance behind gifted possession.

263,263,somalia,"### Offering and Complimenting Items
- In Somalia, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is expected that you politely decline the gesture initially before accepting the third offer. This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.
- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Somali may respond, “No, it’s okay”, out of modesty and politeness even though they intend to accept the second offer.
- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Somali’s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Somali is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.
- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Somalia whereby one’s misfortune can be caused by another’s envy (xasad) of one’s possessions or success, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Do not compliment something more than once or continue to praise it once you have acknowledged it. This may cause a Somali person to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it.
- People say “Mashallah” (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment.
- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. This is done by responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject. If they are Muslim, you may wish them Allah’s (God’s) blessings.

698,698,kenya,"### Basic Etiquette
- The right hand or both hands are used to pass and accept items. The use of the left hand by itself to perform such tasks is considered improper.
- Taking photographs of another person without permission is frowned upon, particularly in rural areas.
- The Kenyan attitude towards time is mostly patient and relaxed. It is common for people to arrive after a designated time, or for services to be delayed by up to 30 to 45 minutes. One reason why perceptions of time in Kenya may differ from the English-speaking West is that many Kenyans operate on both the world time system and on their traditional time system known as ‘Swahili Time'. The latter runs from dawn to dusk to dawn, rather than from midnight to midday to midnight.
",Etiquette,basic_etiquette,Respecting traditional customs and patience in social interactions.,It is okay to be more relaxed about timing and to use the right hand or both hands for passing items.,"At a dinner at her friend's house, Sarah carefully used her right hand to pass the salt to Tom.

581,581,afghanistan,"### Gifts
- Gifts may be given upon visiting someone’s home for the first time.
- If you are invited to lunch or dinner, you may bring a gift that can be eaten for dessert (e.g. fruit, sweets, pastries).
- It is best to be subtle and humble when giving gifts. Walking straight through the door and presenting them with the gift right away would be seen as very forward and puts an Afghan in the awkward position of having to open it in front of you. Instead, try and place it near the door as you enter or on the table as you sit down so that the receiver sees it, but can open it in their own time.
- Do not give alcohol as a gift to a devout Muslim or any Afghan you do not have a close personal relationship with. If you know from first-hand experience that your friend drinks, you may give alcohol, but ensure that it is done covertly so their peers do not know. Revealing to their family or friends the fact that they drink could bring great shame on them.
- It is also inappropriate to give pig/pork-based items, such as leather.
- There are not many special customs concerning gift-wrapping so long as the gift is presented neatly. Green wrapping paper is often used for wedding presents.

363,363,ukraine,"### Basic Etiquette
- Ukrainians generally have a relaxed approach to time. Plans are often discussed loosely in everyday conversation to accommodate for delays (e.g.  “Come around seven” or “Let’s meet at about five”). It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.
- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.
- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.
- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship
- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say ‘no’ to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.
- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere. It is expected that you will insist your help to show the gesture is genuine.
- Blowing one’s nose in public is considered bad manners.
- It is impolite to yawn during conversations with others, or in public without covering your mouth.
- Throwing away food or wasting food is frowned upon, especially bread. Ukrainians tend to repurpose leftovers (e.g. by leaving them outside for stray dogs or birds to eat).
- It is inappropriate for strangers to approach someone else’s child. Close contact or friendliness is frowned upon if you do not know the child (e.g. patting the head or shoulder).
- It is polite to offer one’s seat to an elderly person, pregnant woman or children in public spaces.
- It is respectful to assist older people using transport. Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.
- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.
- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip at least 10% after a meal. Some restaurants may include the tip in the total bill.
- It is uncommon to split the bill evenly in social scenarios. Typically, the person who invited people to the meal pays for the total bill or each person pays for their own order.
