Do you have a moment?\n\n**Klaus:** (pushing a mop bucket) Of course, Hans! What\u2019s going on?\n\n**Hans:** I\u2019ve got a broken water line in the restroom. It\u2019s leaking pretty badly. I\u2019m going to need to fix it, but the floor is a bit slippery. \n\n**Klaus:** Ah, I see. That\u2019s not good. Do you want me to mop it up while you work?\n\n**Hans:** That would be great! I don\u2019t want anyone slipping and getting hurt while I\u2019m in here. \n\n**Klaus:** No problem! I\u2019ll get started right away. (starts mopping the floor) \n\n**Hans:** Thanks, Klaus. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll try to make this quick. \n\n**Klaus:** Take your time. Just let me know if you need any help. \n\n**Hans:** Will do!

But you know how plumbing can be\u2014there\u2019s always a surprise waiting!\n\n**Klaus:** (chuckles) True!

I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s safe for the customers. \n\n**Hans:** Thanks, Klaus. You\u2019re a lifesaver! \n\n**Klaus:** No problem at all! Just another day at the grocery store, right? \n\n**Hans:** Exactly! (continues working) \n\n**Klaus:** (finishing up mopping) Alright, I think that should do it. Just let me know when you\u2019re done, and I\u2019ll check the floor again.\n\n**Hans:** Sounds good! I\u2019ll be out in a jiffy. \n\n---\n\n**(The two continue their tasks, ensuring the grocery store remains safe and functional for customers.)**"}
