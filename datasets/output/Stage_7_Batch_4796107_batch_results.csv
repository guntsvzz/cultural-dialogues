Like for my example, you wouldn't expect a vegetarian to eat meat, especially a worship leader but that may not be at church but somewhere else for example.

But I also think people typically think of church as worship than eating.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","false","true","the PERSON PERFORMING BEHAVIOR's attribute","the PERSON PERFORMING BEHAVIOR's attribute","some OTHER PERSON's role","","is","is","is","","country","condition or state","church role","","the United States of America","homeless","pastor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","false","false","","the PERSON PERFORMING BEHAVIOR's role","the environment","the PERSON PERFORMING BEHAVIOR's attribute","","is","is","is","","church role","holiday or special day","religion","","pastor","Good Friday","Christianity","","the PERSON PERFORMING BEHAVIOR's attribute","the PERSON PERFORMING BEHAVIOR's role","is","is","diet","church role","vegetarian","worship leader","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","false","false"
